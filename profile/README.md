# LabFREED Building Blocks by ApiniLabs
Many concerns of software for laboratories should be solved on a per lab instead of a per vendor base, which is why ApiniLabs is contributing building blocks needed for its own product to the [LabFREED](https://labfreed.org) initiative.

## Published Building Blocks

- [PAC-ID](https://github.com/ApiniLabs/PAC-ID): Standardized Representation for Identifiers Across System Borders
- [PAC-ID Resolver](https://github.com/ApiniLabs/PAC-ID-Resolver): Service Discovery and Seamless User Handovers Across System Borders
- [TREX](https://github.com/ApiniLabs/T-REX): QR/DataMatrix optimized data serialization
